Hi,
I've got this file called welcome.blade.php

when i use the for each to display categories, it'll display double the normal number.
Here i have just two categories, but it'll display it twice making it 4. 
Please help me find what my issues is, I appreciate it.
I'm just a beginner.
The images and code are part of this directory. Thanks
